 Prefect integration for working with dbt
 
-## Getting Started
 
-### Python setup
+<!--- ### Add a real-world example of how to use this Collection here
 
-Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.
+Offer some motivation on why this helps.
 
-We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.
+After installing `prefect-dbt` and [saving the credentials](#saving-credentials-to-block), you can easily use it within your flows to help you achieve the aforementioned benefits!
 
-These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).
+```python
+from prefect import flow, get_run_logger

+A list of available blocks in `prefect-dbt` and their setup instructions can be found [here](https://PrefectHQ.github.io/prefect-dbt/blocks-catalog).
 
-```bash
-prefect block register -m prefect_dbt.credentials
-```
+Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.
 
-Note, to use the `load` method on Blocks, you must already have a block document [saved through code](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/blocks/#saving-blocks) or [saved through the UI](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/).
+We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.
 
-### Write and run a flow
+These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).
 
-```python
-from prefect import flow
-from prefect_dbt.tasks import (
-    goodbye_prefect_dbt,
-    hello_prefect_dbt,
-)
+<!--- ### Saving credentials to block
 
+Replace this with actual instructions on how to get API key or token.

-    hello_prefect_dbt
-    goodbye_prefect_dbt
+1. Head over to 
+2. Login to your SERVICE account
+3. Click "+ Create new secret key"
+4. Copy the generated API key
+5. Create a short script, replacing the placeholders (or do so in the UI)
 
-example_flow()
+```python
+from prefect_dbt import Block`
+Block(api_key="API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER").save("BLOCK_NAME_PLACEHOLDER")
 ```
 
-## Resources
+Congrats! You can now easily load the saved block, which holds your credentials:
+
+```python
+from prefect_dbt import Block
+Block.load("BLOCK_NAME_PLACEHOLDER")
